title: Starting with Spring Initializr
---

To manually initialize the project:

1.  Select the **Spring Initializr** tab to the right. This service
    pulls in all the dependencies you need for an application and does
    most of the setup for you. In order to setup for this guide,
    configure your application as follows:

2.  Choose `Gradle-Groovy` as your **Project** type.

3.  Choose `Java` as the **Language** you want to use.

4.  In the **Project Metadata** section, set the value of the
    **Artifact** field to `springboot`.

5.  Click **Add Dependencies** in the upper right (or **Add** in the
    lower right) for smaller screen resolution) and select `Spring Web`.

6.  Click the **Create** button.

You will see that the resulting project is downloaded as a ZIP file:
`springboot.zip`, and then unzipped in the **Terminal** tab, to the
right, into the `springboot` directory. This directory contains a
ready-to-run Spring Boot application. For the rest of the guide, youâ€™ll
be editing the application. Go ahead and explore it using the **Editor**
tab to the right.
