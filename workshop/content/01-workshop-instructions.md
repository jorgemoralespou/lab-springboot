title: What You Will build
---

Starting from scratch, you will build a starter app with Spring
Initializr, and from it create a simple Spring Boot web application
which includes some useful services.

In order to create your own Spring Boot-based project, normally you
would visit [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/), fill in your
project details, pick your options, and download a bundled up project as
a zip file. In this lab, weâ€™ve provided Spring Initializer in the tab to
the right.
